**Antigravity Phone Connect** is a high-performance, real-time mobile monitor and remote control for your Antigravity AI sessions. It allows you to step away from your desk while keeping full sight and control over your AI's thinking process and generations.

## 🚀 Quick Start

> 💡 **Tip:** While we recommend starting Antigravity first, the server is now smart enough to wait and automatically connect whenever Antigravity becomes available!

### Step 1: Launch Antigravity in Debug Mode

Start Antigravity with the remote debugging port enabled:

**Option A: Using Right-Click Context Menu (Recommended)**
- Run `install_context_menu.bat` (Windows) or `./install_context_menu.sh` (Linux) and select **[1] Install**
- Then right-click any project folder → **"Open with Antigravity (Debug)"** (now with visual icons!)

**Option B: Manual Command**
```bash
antigravity . --remote-debugging-port=9000
```

### Step 2: Open or Start a Chat

- In Antigravity, open an **existing chat** from the bottom-right panel, **OR**
- Start a **new chat** by typing a message

> 💡 The server needs an active chat session to capture snapshots. Without this, you'll see "chat container not found" errors.

### Step 3: Run the Server

**Windows:**
```
Double-click start_ag_phone_connect.bat
```

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
chmod +x start_ag_phone_connect.sh   # First time only
./start_ag_phone_connect.sh
```

The script will:
- Verify Node.js and Python dependencies
- Auto-kill any existing server on port 3000
- **Wait for Antigravity** if it's not started yet
- Display a **QR Code** and your **Link** (e.g., `https://192.168.1.5:3000`)
- Provide numbered steps for easy connection

### Step 4: Connect Your Phone (Local Wi-Fi)

1. Ensure your phone is on the **same Wi-Fi network** as your PC
2. Open your mobile browser and enter the **URL shown in the terminal**
3. If using HTTPS: Accept the self-signed certificate warning on first visit

---

## 🌍 NEW: Global Remote Access (Web Mode)

Access your Antigravity session from **anywhere in the world** (Mobile Data, outside Wi-Fi) with secure passcode protection.

### Setup (First Time)
1. **Get an ngrok Token**: Sign up for free at [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com) and get your "Authtoken".
2. **Automatic Configuration (Recommended)**: Simply run any launcher script. They will detect if `.env` is missing and automatically create it using `.env.example` as a template.
3. **Manual Setup**: Alternatively, copy `.env.example` to `.env` manually and update the values:
   ```bash
   copy .env.example .env   # Windows
   cp .env.example .env     # Mac/Linux
   ```
   Update the `.env` file with your details:
   ```env
   NGROK_AUTHTOKEN=your_token_here
   APP_PASSWORD=your_secure_passcode
   XXX_API_KEY=your-ai-provider-key
   PORT=3000
   ```

### Usage
- **Windows**: Run `start_ag_phone_connect_web.bat`
- **Mac/Linux**: Run `./start_ag_phone_connect_web.sh`

The script will launch the server and provide a **Public URL** (e.g., `https://abcd-123.ngrok-free.app`). 

**Two Ways to Connect:**
1. **Magic Link (Easiest)**: Scan the **Magic QR Code** displayed in the terminal. It logs you in automatically!
2. **Manual**: 
   - Open the URL on your phone.
   - Enter your `APP_PASSWORD` to log in.

> 💡 **Tip:** Devices on the same local Wi-Fi still enjoy direct access without needing a password.

## 🔒 Enabling HTTPS (Recommended)

For a secure connection without the browser warning icon:

### Option 1: Command Line
```bash
node generate_ssl.js
```
- Uses **OpenSSL** if available (includes your IP in certificate)
- Falls back to **Node.js crypto** if OpenSSL not found
- Creates certificates in `./certs/` directory

### Option 2: Web UI
1. Start the server on HTTP
2. Look for the yellow **"⚠️ Not Secure"** banner
3. Click **"Enable HTTPS"** button
4. Restart the server when prompted

### After Generating:
1. **Restart the server** - it will automatically detect and use HTTPS.
2. **On your phone's first visit**:
   - You'll see a security warning (normal for self-signed certs).
   - Tap **"Advanced"** → **"Proceed to site"**.
   - The warning won't appear again!

---

### macOS: Adding Right-Click "Quick Action" (Optional)

Since macOS requires Automator for context menu entries, follow these steps manually:

1.  Open **Automator** (Spotlight → type "Automator").
2.  Click **File → New** and select **Quick Action**.
3.  At the top, set:
    - "Workflow receives current" → **folders**
    - "in" → **Finder**
4.  In the left sidebar, search for **"Run Shell Script"** and drag it to the right pane.
5.  Set "Shell" to `/bin/zsh` and "Pass input" to **as arguments**.
6.  Paste this script:
    ```bash
    cd "$1"
    antigravity . --remote-debugging-port=9000
    ```
7.  **Save** the Quick Action with a name like `Open with Antigravity (Debug)`.
8.  Now you can right-click any folder in Finder → **Quick Actions → Open with Antigravity (Debug)**.

## ✨ Features

- **🧹 Clean Mobile View (NEW!)**: Automatically filters out "Review Changes" bars, "Linked Objects," and Desktop-specific input areas to keep your phone view focused purely on the chat and code content.
- **Glassmorphism UI (NEW!)**: Sleek and modern quick-action and settings menus featuring a beautiful glassmorphism effect for enhanced mobile usability. Includes customizable, ready-to-use prompt pills (like "Explain this code", "Continue", and "Fix Bugs").
- **🌙 Improved Dark Mode (NEW!)**: Enhanced UI styling and state capture designed to provide maximum clarity and correct model detection in dark mode.
- **🧠 Latest AI Models**: Automatically updated support for the latest model versions from Gemini, Claude, and OpenAI.
