# 📦 Release Notes

All notable changes to **Antigravity Phone Connect** are documented here, in reverse chronological order (latest first).

---

## v0.2.28 - UI/UX Pro Max & The Obsidian Overhaul 💎
**Release Date:** February 27, 2026

---

### ✨ The "Obsidian" Visual Overhaul
- **Aesthetic Excellence**: Completely reimagined the mobile interface with a deep, "Space Black" palette and gorgeous violet-to-indigo gradients. It's our most premium-feeling update yet.
- **Glassmorphic Prompt Area**: Refined the quick-action pills (Continue, Explain, Fix Bugs) with elegant glassmorphism effects and micro-animations. Pills now "float" and glow with subtle violet shadows when interacted with.
- **Symmetric Controls**: Re-styled the History button to match the minimalist, icon-only design of the Refresh button for a cleaner, unified header aesthetic.

### 🚀 New Features & Deep Sync
- **Explain Pill**: Added a dedicated "Explain" quick-action pill for one-tap, detailed code breakdowns.
- **Dynamic Glows**: Interactive elements now emit a soft indigo/violet glow, matching the theme's core accent for better visual feedback.
- **Perfect Sync (v0.2.26)**: Dismissing the mobile history layer now automatically triggers a remote "Escape" sequence to close the desktop history panel instantly.
- **Premium History Cards (v0.2.25)**: Completely redesigned the history view with elevated, interactive cards and smooth transitions.

### 🛡️ Security & Auditing
- **OWASP Security Audit**: Performed a "Paranoid Mode" security sweep across the entire codebase.
- **Audit Logging**: Updated `SECURITY.md` with detailed findings on secrets management, injection prevention, and authentication protocols.
- **Verified Protection**: Confirmed that the CDP injection layer remains strictly scoped and secure against XSS.

### 📚 Documentation
- **Technical Sync**: Updated `CODE_DOCUMENTATION.md` and `DESIGN_PHILOSOPHY.md` to reflect the new visual architecture and human-centric design choices.

---

## v0.2.24 - Deterministic Targeting & Security Hardening 🎯
**Release Date:** February 26, 2026

---

### 🚀 New Features & Precision Controls
- **Deterministic Targeting Engine**: Completely solved the "Duplicate Element Mismatch" issue. Interactive elements like "Run", "Reject", and "Thought" toggles now use dynamic occurrence index tracking to ensure your tap hits the exact message you intended, even in long chat histories with many identical buttons.
- **Leaf-Most Filtering**: Introduced a "Zero-Proxy Filter" on the server. The system now automatically identifies and targets the inner-most interactive node, preventing "Nested DOM Traps" where clicks would land on parent containers instead of the actual button.
- **Strict Scoped Clicking**: CDP clicks are now prioritized within the active chat cascade (`#conversation`, `#cascade`), ensuring that historical buttons are matched with 100% precision while ignoring unrelated sidebar controls.
- **Enhanced Thought Matching**: Thought toggles now use strict first-line text matching (e.g., "Thought for 2s") to reliably distinguish between multiple reasoning blocks in a single session.

### 🛡️ Security & Infrastructure
- **Security Secret Externalization**: Removed hardcoded secrets for signed cookies and authentication salts. All sensitive security tokens can now be customized via `.env` to invalidate sessions or harden the server.
- **Full Security Audit**: Conducted a formal security sweep (OWASP scope) and documented the results in `SECURITY.md`. Confirmed robust protection against XSS and CDP injection.
- **Enhanced .env Template**: Updated `.env.example` with new optional security parameters for advanced users.

### 📚 Documentation
- **Technical Deep-Dive**: Updated `CODE_DOCUMENTATION.md` with details on the new Dual-Pass targeting architecture and Leaf-Node isolation logic.
- **Ideological Alignment**: Refined `DESIGN_PHILOSOPHY.md` to reflect the move toward "Robustness with Zero-Proxy Precision."
